							<h1>What is a Founder?</h1>
						</section>
						<section class="content">
							<p>"Founder" is a term which has gained popularity in Silicon Valley for someone who successfully initiates a technology-related startup.</p>

<p>We believe that being a Founder does not stop at just entrepreneurship. Founders thrive in many different leadership settings such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship" target="_blank">intrapreneurship</a>, project management, and even technical roles where one must lead a team of say, product engineers.</p>

<p>Exceptional Founders are able to manage teams effectively while maximizing potential, communicate clearly and persuasively, formulate realistic strategies to achieve ambitious goals, and consistently augment the success of their ideas, projects and ventures.</p>
