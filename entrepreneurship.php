					<p>The Idea-A-Thon is a fast paced viable business idea generation event, but just one of many hosted by the Entrepreneurship portfolio this year. Attendees will connect with their existing friends as well as other club members in multiple rounds of idea generation. Similar to a Hackathon, where individuals generate an idea and see it to fruition, the Idea-A-Thon focuses in on the key step of generating a viable business idea. Members will weigh industry trends, other startups, and anticipate future demand in small teams to conceptualize viable business opportunities.
