					<h1 class="small-caps">Venture Capital</h1>
					<p> New to The Founders Network is the venture capital branch which aims to support student entrepreneurs and startups. It will have the profound ability to connect startups with sponsors and various investment resources to ease the development in the early stages of the business, especially when alternative forms of financing are too limiting or too hard to secure. Resources will be made available to projects that have generated community support and/or recognized by the Founders Network. Projects will be assessed on the quality of their management team, the feasibility of the business plan, the originality of the proposal, and the progresses of the early product.
