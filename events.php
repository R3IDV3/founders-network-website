						<h1 class="fit">Global Entrepreneurship Week</h1>
						<h2 class="small-caps">November <span class="char">16-24th</span>, <span class="char">2015</span></h2>
						<p>Global Entrepreneurship Week is the world's largest celebration of innovation and change. Every year we kick off the week with a Startup Showcase, a grand celebration that brings together students with professors and Western alumni of whom have successfully launched self-started organizations and businesses. Together we cultivate new connections through sharing experiences and communicating individual journeys. These speakers are meant to inspire ideas within yourself not to mention provide meaningful and realistic guidance to those who seek it.
	This event is the perfect synergy between good food and even better people, it is your opportunity to discover your inner entrepreneur as well as meet the people who will help you get there.</p>

						<h2 class="small-caps">March, <span class="char">2016</span></h2>
						<p>Last year the Founders Network hosted Canada's first Microsoft Case Competition with more than 40 teams and 180 contestants competing. In association with Microsoft Canada, the competition intends to promote students from non-technical backgrounds to become more involved with utilizing technological platforms in a business setting. A thorough knowledge of how to apply technological programs and software to solve relevant industry problems gives you an obvious advantage in any field of interest. With the Founders Network you can learn to gain that advantage because we have the resources and ability to teach you.</p>
