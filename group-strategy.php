    				<p>Western Founders Network is built upon three pillars designed to complement one another in order to prepare you for a career in technology, consulting, product management, or entrepreneurship.
						<br>
						<br>
						While our education portfolio aims at helping members hone in their technical skills with projects and seminars, our industry portfolio focuses on getting our members involved with the industry through consulting case competitions & career panels. They work in conjunction with the entrepreneurship group which connects our members with successful entrepreneurs from Western and beyond.
